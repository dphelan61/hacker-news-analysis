    "# Conclusion\n",
    "It appears that Ask Posts posted around 3:00 PM EST have the most comments on average compared to Ask Posts posted at other hours during the day, followed by 2:00 AM EST, 8:00 PM EST, 4:00 PM EST, then 9:00 PM EST. It appears that our hypothesis did get the 8:00 and 9:00 times right; however, we were incorrect in missing the late afternoon times and very late night time. One potential reason for the high amount of comments on Ask Posts made around 3:00 and 4:00 PM EST could be that these are commented on folks on the west coast in PST during their lunch break. This is assuming that a large majority of Hacker News readers live on the west coast where most major tech companies and Silicon Valley lie. We would just need somewhere that shows the location of comments in the data set if that could somehow be captured. In addition, the 2:00 AM EST Ask Posts could be commented by folks winding down and going to bed in other time zones, or, and I'm not sure if Hacker News ranks Ask Posts by most recent posts, but I could see how most folks on their way to work or getting up in the morning would see those posts made at 2:00 AM EST at the top of their feed, thus making these posts made by night owls commented on by the early birds."
